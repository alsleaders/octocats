# Octocats

<img src="/src/images/Octocats.png>

This was my first React project and I really loved it. I thought it was fun and the content made me smile every time I made a change. In addition to being able to get my hands dirty working with components, I was pleased to be able to design something fun and visually pleasing.

<h3> Planned Updates </h3>
In the future I intend to:
<ul>
  <li> add more cats using the api at https://sdg-octodex.herokuapp.com/ </li>
  <li> make the site more mobile friendly by adding media query breakpoints in the css </li>
  <li> add functionality to the nav bar </li>
</ul>
